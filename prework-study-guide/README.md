# Prework Site for Studying

## Description

 I needed a head-start to help me hit the ground running in my coding-bootcamp. So I created a webpage that helps me refer back to the basics and have something as a base of knowledge and utilizes different languages to refresh what I learned. Now I have something to look back to if I ever forget in the beginning stages and support me in further exploring each language in my coding journey. For future references, I could continue building such webpages for future languages learned or more complex concepts.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.
